Error: Cannot compare tz-naive and tz-aware timestamps
Location: Signal generation loop
Impact: Prevents signal calculation
Status: Identified, solution straightforward
```

### **Quick Fix Required:**
```python
# In backtesting_engine.py, line ~47
# Change this:
for date in data.index:
    
# To this:  
for date in data.index:
    date = date.tz_localize(None) if date.tz is not None else date
```
