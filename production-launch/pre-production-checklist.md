## 🧪 Pre-Production Testing Scripts

### Cluster Connectivity Test
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔍 Testing Kubernetes cluster connectivity..."

# Test cluster access
kubectl cluster-info

# Test node readiness
kubectl get nodes

# Test namespace access
kubectl get namespaces

echo "✅ Cluster connectivity validated"
```

### Container Registry Test
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔍 Testing container registry access..."

# Test image pull
docker pull ghcr.io/your-org/signal-trading/data-service:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/your-org/signal-trading/gateway-service:latest

# Test image availability
kubectl run test-pod --image=ghcr.io/your-org/signal-trading/data-service:latest --dry-run=client -o yaml

echo "✅ Container registry access validated"
```

### DNS and SSL Test
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔍 Testing DNS and SSL configuration..."

# Test DNS resolution
nslookup api.signaltrading.com

# Test SSL certificate
openssl s_client -connect api.signaltrading.com:443 -servername api.signaltrading.com < /dev/null

# Test certificate expiry
echo | openssl s_client -connect api.signaltrading.com:443 -servername api.signaltrading.com 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates

echo "✅ DNS and SSL validated"
```

### Database Connectivity Test
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔍 Testing database connectivity..."

# Test Redis connectivity (if using external Redis)
redis-cli -h your-redis-host.com ping

# Test database creation (for SQLite)
kubectl exec -it deployment/data-service -- sqlite3 /data/service.db ".tables"

echo "✅ Database connectivity validated"
```
